# LettersRecognation

Utilizing the Python-OpenCV library, this application demonstrates the straightforward recognition of letters. The program effectively filters out smaller characters and isolates objects of specified dimensions. Predetermined letters undergo scrutiny to ascertain their quality, with additional scrutiny applied to their color attributes. Upon completion of the process, a comprehensive report is generated, detailing the quantity of letters, categorized by color, deemed either satisfactory or defective.
